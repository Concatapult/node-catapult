# Node catapult is DEPRECATED - Please use [pult](https://github.com/Concatapult/pult) instead, a much better alternative!

A boilerplate starter project that includes Node, Express, Browserify, and Mithril:

* Minimal - Understand everything.
* Efficient - Great defaults for development and production.
* Rapid - Get started immediately.

## Getting Started

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. To run the tests, simply run `npm test`.

## Jump-starting your App

[Check the wiki](https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult/wiki) for snippets to jump-start your app, including:

- Support for SASS and Babel
- How to set up React.js
- Express cookie sessions
- Postgres and knex.js
- A functional-programming-based "ORM" pattern for your database models

## Browserify Middleware

The most notable part of this app is [browserify-middleware](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/browserify-middleware). Great node packages are exceedingly rare â€“ this is one of those packages.
